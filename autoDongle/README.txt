WELCOME TO AUTODONGLE

The program helps you record macros and then run them automatically. Here is how to use it:

1/ Install the required packages needed to run the program: run "sh setUp.sh" in the command line

2/ Record your macro: Insert your dongle. When it is recognised, run "sh record.sh" in the command line and follow the instructions. Your macro will be saved in the folder macros/. Please be aware that the macro has memorized the devices (display, mouse, keyboard) that you used during the recording, and won't work using other devices.

3/ Run your macro: run "sh run.sh"

Note: it can happen that the macro program doesn't exit properly. In that case, help it quit by pressing Ctrl+C.

Here you go!
